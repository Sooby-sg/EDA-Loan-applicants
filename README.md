Conducted a case study to identify patterns indicating clients' difficulties in paying installments using exploratory data analysis (EDA). Utilized findings to inform decisions on loan denial, adjustment of loan amounts, and application of higher interest rates for risky applicants, ensuring eligible consumers were not rejected.
